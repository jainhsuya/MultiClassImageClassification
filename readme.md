Group Project  
Image based classification of waste material :  
A Machine Learning Project in Python with 95 % accuracy rate on collected dataset and 93 % on independent data set.  
Algorithm Used â€“ Convolutional Neural Networks.  
Classification is based on Transfer Learning and uses the Inception Model v3 of Google.  
category of the image as plastic ,glass,paper,cardboard,metal.  
  
project proposes an idea where a computer on its own is
able to recognize the waste without human intervention based on the material of the item, irrespective of its shape and size, easily and classify them.  
steps:  
  
1. Recognising small patterns in image matrix.  
2. Assigning values to feature maps based on weighted values of previous neurons.  
3. Detecting bigger patterns based on combination of small patterns.  
4. Calculating the score of each category based on final layer of feature map
values.
